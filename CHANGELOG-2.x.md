# Docusaurus 2 Changelog

## Unreleased

- Do not escape html and body attributes
- For devices with very small viewport width, the searchbar is replaced with a search icon. On tap of the search icon the searchbar is expanded and the text beside the logo is hidden and remains hidden while the search bar is expanded.
- Add `date` frontMatter support for blog plugin
- Add `truncateMarker` option to blog plugin, support string or regex.
- Webpack `optimization.removeAvailableModules` is now disabled for performance gain. See https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v4.38.0 for more context.

## 2.0.0-alpha.24

- Remove unused metadata for pages. This minimize number of http request & smaller bundle size.
- Upgrade dependencies of css-loader from 2.x to 3.x. Css modules localIdentName hash now only use the last 4 characters instead of 8.
- Fix broken markdown linking replacement for mdx files
- Fix potential security vulnerability because we're exposing the directory structure of the host machine. Instead of absolute path, we use relative path from site directory. Resulting in shorter webpack chunk naming and smaller bundle size. 
- Use contenthash instead of chunkhash for better long term caching
- Allow user to customize generated heading from MDX. Swizzle `@theme/Heading`

## 2.0.0-alpha.23

- Fix docusaurus route config generation for certain edge case

## 2.0.0-alpha.22

- Add missing dependencies on `@docusaurus/preset-classic`
- New plugin `@docusaurus/plugin-ideal-image` to generate an almost ideal image (responsive, lazy-loading, and low quality placeholder)
- Better Twitter/discord image preview. Previously the size is too zoomed
- Allow prism syntax highlighting theme customization. Refer to https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features#syntax-highlighting
- CSS is now autoprefixed using postcss
- Faster, lighter webpack bundle size
- `@docusaurus/theme-live-codeblock` is now much smaller in size and no longer only load on viewport
- Blog markdown files now support using the id field to specify the path

## 2.0.0-alpha.21

- Fix babel-loader not transpiling docusaurus package

## 2.0.0-alpha.20

- Add copy codeblock button
- Add Google analytics and Google gtag plugins.
- Move source components to `/src`. Please create a `website/src` directory and move your `/pages` and `/theme` code into it. This is to make it easier to integrate your website with external build/static analysis tooling (you can now just pass in `src/**/*.js` as the path to process).
- Adde more documentation thanks to @wgao19.
- Deprecate the current docs plugin. The docs plugin as of 2.0.0-alpha.19 is heavily based on V1 specifications and we intend to create a better one that fixes some of the inconsistencies in V1. If you have swizzled any doc components, you will have to update their names. You are highly encourages to not swizzle the legacy doc components until we have completed the new docs plugin.
- Separate v2 init command to new package @docusaurus/init
- Render 404.html page
- Improve SEO
- Clicking on the logo in the mobile sliding navigation will now bring you to the homepage.
- Performance
  - Disable webpack output pathinfo. Webpack has the ability to generate path info in the output bundle. However, this puts garbage collection pressure on projects that bundle thousands of modules. Not very useful for our case
  - Drop cache-loader in CI and test environment because it has an initial overhead. We always start from scratch in vm instance like CI so cache-loader is useless
  - Better splitchunks and babel default webpack config

## 2.0.0-alpha.19

- Add a sensible default for browserslist config.
- UI
  - Add sun and moon emoji to the dark mode toggle.
  - Mobile responsive menu.
  - Right table of contents for docs is now sticky.
- Plugins
  - Change plugin definitions from classes to functions. Refer to the new plugin docs.
  - Implement Clients module API.
  - Change format within `docusaurus.config.js` to be like presets.
- Deps
  - Infima CSS is now locked down to specific versions and not relying upon the CDN which reads from trunk.
  - Update dependencies to latest
- Customize/ Override infima CSS variables by passing options into the classic preset.

```
presets: [
  [
    '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
    {
      theme: {
        customCss: require.resolve('./css/custom.css'),
      },
      ...
    },
  ],
],
```

- Allow passing remark and rehype plugins to mdx-loader for docs and blog plugin
- Move themes component of docs and blog to be part of theme-classic
- Use composition style for prism syntax highlighting instead of doing it via rehype plugin
- Pass MDXProvider to docs and blog. To change the provided MDX components, run `docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic MDXComponents`
- Add @docusaurus/theme-livecodeblock plugin
- Better run-time code generation & webpack splitchunks optimization
- Minify css for production build
- Fix weird scrolling problem when navigating to a route with a `hash` location
